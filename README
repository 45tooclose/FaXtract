Description:
- Connects to email mailboxes via IMAP4 and extracts attached fax PDF files.

  FaXtract was created to solve a particular problem at my office, in which incoming
  faxes needed to be retrieved from email and put into an imaging system. Thus, its
  suitability to your purposes will vary.

Usage:
- Configure FaXtract.ini with the global options and mailboxes you want to check.
- Use command-line option '/report' to send an email report on the received faxes.

Requirments:
- Python 2.x

Platforms:
- Should work on any platform with a Python interpretter, but my intention
  was to use it as a Windows service. (Run setup.cmd to build with Py2EXE.)
